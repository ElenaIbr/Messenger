# Messenger

Hi everyone!
Here i would like to describe my mobile web app. 
This app is the solution for communication, or just messenger like Whats`app, Viber, Telegram and so on. 
I have been trying to realize main functionality and cover MVP requirements.
Of course, there is still a lot of work, but the app does its main function, 
giving opportunity to send and get messages from other users. What i used to achieve this purpose:
1. realasing application within single activity (1 activity and 7 fragments were enough)
2. Firebase tools (auth, database)
3. FCM and Retrofit2 for push-notifications
